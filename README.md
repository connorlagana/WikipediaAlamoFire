# WikipediaAlamoFire

Wikipedia's API is somewhat more complex than your average API.  WikipediaAlamoFire showcases a standard Wikipedia 
viewer using the API.  All of the UI is done programatically and using UIKit.  

WikipediaAlamoFire allows for the user to search for articles and read about them.
